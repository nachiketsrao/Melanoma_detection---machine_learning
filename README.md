# Skin cancer detection using machine learning in Python

## Information on the data
The dataset to train and test the model has been taken from the ISIC(International Skin Image Collaboration) Archive. It consists of 1800 pictures of benign moles and 1497 pictures of malignant classified moles. The pictures have all been resized to low resolution (224x224x3) RGB. It has 2 different classesof skin cancer which are listed below:1. Benign2. MalignantWe try to detect 2 different classes of moles using Convolution Neural Networkswith Keras Library with TensorFlowin the backend and then analyzethe result to see how the model can be useful in practical scenarios.Training-80% of the data  --2637 imagesTesting-20% of the data  --660 images
